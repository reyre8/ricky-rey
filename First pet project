First pet project

Develop a system that allows Zaras floor managers to set up and arrange the rotation schedule of their employees on daily basis. Sending notifications to everyone of the employees via mail and or sms 

The problem

Currently the floor manager of Zara Henry Street arranges the schedule of employees rotation by hand on a sheet of paper that employees photograph and share via social networks. Of course this tents to  be buggy for both managers and employees. 

First the manager has to be careful  not to overlap to employees, no to overassign hours to an employee and so on. 


Seconds the employees have to constantly check the rotation sheet. Because there are last minute changes and even if the employee doesn't work that day they need to have a copy of the rotation sheet to be aware if the next day they will work and the hours they will do. 

The solution. 

A web based applications where the manager can drag and drop employees from a list of employees available to the shift block they need to be covered. 

The system will show the maximum amount of hours an employee can make weekly  and automatically rest the hours assigned to that numbers making it easier for the manager. 

The system will print the agreed schedule to a physical sheet of paper to be published in the information board visble for every one. 

Aditionally the system will send notification to all employees affected by the changes  via mail and or sms or any other communication Chanel. 

The unfinished schedule should be available as well to keep track of status. 

The system should allow employees to request revision or notify absence to be approved by management and reassign those missing hours to another employee. The system should suggest the best options based on availability and eagerness of employees to make more hours.
